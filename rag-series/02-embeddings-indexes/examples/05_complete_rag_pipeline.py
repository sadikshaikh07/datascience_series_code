Blog 2.2 - Complete RAG Pipeline Integration
===========================================

This script demonstrates a complete end-to-end RAG pipeline integrating all concepts:
- Document chunking strategies
- Embedding generation and normalization
- Index selection and optimization  
- Retrieval with similarity metrics
- Hybrid search (BM25 + Vector)
- Production-ready implementation patterns

Covers blog sections:
- 5️⃣ Retrieval Mechanics (End-to-End)
- Complete pipeline: Text → Chunk → Embed → Index → Query → Retrieve
- Best practices and production patterns

            Our comprehensive benefits package is designed to support employee health, 
            financial security, and professional development throughout their career journey.
            
            Health insurance coverage includes medical, dental, and vision benefits through 
            premium providers. The company contributes 80% of employee premiums and 60% 
            of dependent coverage premiums. Open enrollment occurs annually in November 
            with benefits effective January 1st.
            
            Retirement planning is supported through our 401(k) program with company matching 
            up to 4% of salary. Vesting occurs immediately for employee contributions and 
            follows a 3-year graded schedule for company matches. Financial planning 
            resources and advisory services are available through our benefits provider.
            
            Professional development funding provides up to $2000 annually for approved 
            training, conferences, certifications, and educational courses. Employees must 
            submit requests with business justification 30 days in advance. Tuition 
            reimbursement up to $5000 per year is available for job-related degree programs.
            
            Time off benefits include vacation time starting at 15 days for new employees, 
            increasing to 20 days after 2 years and 25 days after 5 years of service. 
            Personal days, sick leave, and holiday pay are provided in addition to vacation time.
            
            Additional perks include flexible spending accounts for healthcare and dependent care, 
            life insurance coverage, employee assistance programs, and wellness initiatives 
            including gym membership reimbursements and mental health support services.
