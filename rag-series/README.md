# Series 2: RAG Systems - Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Complete practical code examples for the **RAG Systems** series from the comprehensive Data Science Blog Series.

## 📚 Series Context & Position

This is **Series 2** of the complete Data Science learning path, focusing on how AI agents access and use external knowledge. RAG is a **core technology** that bridges the gap between LLMs and real-world data.

### 🎯 Series Position in Learning Path
- **Series 1:** AI Fundamentals & Agent Basics ✅ **Required Prerequisite**
- **Series 2:** RAG Systems ← **You Are Here**
