Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Prompting Examples
Blog 2: Prompt Engineering Fundamentals - Advanced Section

Tree-of-Thought prompting explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously,
evaluating different approaches before converging on the best solution.
More sophisticated than Chain-of-Thought for complex problems.

Use cases: Complex problem-solving, creative tasks, strategic planning, optimization
