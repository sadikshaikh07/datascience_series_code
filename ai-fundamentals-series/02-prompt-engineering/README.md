## üéØ What You'll Learn

- **Core prompting techniques**: Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought
- **Prompt optimization**: How to get consistent, high-quality responses
- **Advanced patterns**: Complex reasoning and multi-step problem solving
- **Production practices**: Error handling, validation, and prompt management

## üìö Key Concepts

### Prompting Techniques Explained

1. **Zero-Shot Prompting** (`zero_shot.py`)
   - Direct instructions without examples
   - Best for: Simple tasks, general knowledge, standard operations
   - Example: "Translate this text to French: Hello, how are you?"

2. **Few-Shot Prompting** (`few_shot.py`)  
   - Learning from provided examples
   - Best for: Specific formats, domain-specific tasks, style consistency
   - Example: Show 2-3 examples of desired output format

3. **Chain-of-Thought** (`chain_of_thought.py`)
   - Step-by-step reasoning process
   - Best for: Math problems, logical reasoning, complex analysis
   - Example: "Let's think step by step..."

4. **Tree-of-Thought** (`tree_of_thought.py`)
   - Exploring multiple reasoning paths
   - Best for: Creative problems, multiple solutions, uncertainty
   - Example: Generate and evaluate multiple approaches

## üöÄ Running the Examples

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies  
pip install -r ../shared/requirements.txt

# Set up your OpenAI API key
cp ../shared/.env.example ../.env
# Edit .env and add: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### Individual Techniques
```bash
# Test each prompting technique
python examples/zero_shot.py
python examples/few_shot.py
python examples/chain_of_thought.py
python examples/tree_of_thought.py
```

### Complete Demo
```bash
# Compare all techniques side-by-side
python examples/demo_all_prompts.py
```

## üé≠ Example Use Cases

### Zero-Shot Examples
- Text translation and summarization
- Classification and categorization  
- Simple question answering
- Format conversion

### Few-Shot Examples  
- Custom writing styles
- Specific data extraction formats
- Domain-specific analysis
- Structured output generation

### Chain-of-Thought Examples
- Mathematical problem solving
- Logical reasoning tasks
- Complex analysis with steps
- Debugging and troubleshooting

### Tree-of-Thought Examples
- Creative writing and ideation
- Strategic planning
- Problem-solving with multiple approaches
- Decision-making under uncertainty

## üéì Learning Progression

1. **Master Zero-Shot**: Start with clear, direct instructions
2. **Add Few-Shot**: Use examples to show desired format/style
3. **Chain Reasoning**: Break complex problems into steps  
4. **Explore Alternatives**: Consider multiple approaches with tree-of-thought
5. **Optimize Prompts**: Test and refine for your specific use cases

## üí° Best Practices

### Prompt Design Principles
- **Be specific**: Clear, detailed instructions work better
- **Provide context**: Give the AI relevant background information
- **Use examples**: Show don't just tell (few-shot)
- **Break it down**: Complex tasks benefit from step-by-step reasoning
- **Test variations**: Different phrasings can yield better results

### Production Tips
- **Validate outputs**: Always check AI responses for accuracy
- **Handle errors**: Implement retry logic and fallback prompts
- **Version control**: Track prompt changes and performance
- **A/B test**: Compare different prompt variations
- **Monitor costs**: Longer prompts = higher API costs

## üîß Technical Details

### Supported Models
- **GPT-4**: Best performance, higher cost
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: Good balance of speed and capability
- **Compatible APIs**: Ollama, LocalAI, etc. (set `OPENAI_BASE_URL`)

### Hyperparameters
- **Temperature**: 0.0 (deterministic) to 2.0 (very creative)
- **Max tokens**: Response length limit
- **Top-p**: Vocabulary diversity control
- See `../shared/.env.example` for configuration options
