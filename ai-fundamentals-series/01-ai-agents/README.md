## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Agent architectures**: Reflex, Model-based, Goal-based, Utility-based, Learning
- **Decision-making patterns**: How agents choose actions based on different approaches  
- **Hybrid systems**: Combining multiple agent types for complex behaviors
- **Practical implementation**: Smart home automation as a real-world example

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Agent Types Explained

1. **Reflex Agent** (`reflex_agent.py`)
   - Simple condition-action rules
   - Fast responses to immediate stimuli
   - Example: Motion sensor → Start recording

2. **Model-Based Agent** (`model_based_agent.py`)
   - Maintains internal state/memory
   - Tracks how the world changes
   - Example: Home security with occupancy tracking

3. **Goal-Based Agent** (`goal_based_agent.py`)
   - Plans actions to achieve specific goals
   - Uses search and planning algorithms  
   - Example: Optimize home energy usage

4. **Utility-Based Agent** (`utility_based_agent.py`)
   - Maximizes utility/satisfaction scores
   - Handles conflicting objectives
   - Example: Balance comfort, security, and energy efficiency

5. **Learning Agent** (`learning_agent.py`)
   - Adapts behavior based on experience
   - Improves performance over time
   - Example: Learn family routines and preferences

6. **Hybrid Agent** (`hybrid_agent.py`)
   - Combines multiple approaches
   - Uses the best strategy for each situation
   - Example: Production-ready smart home system

## 🚀 Running the Examples

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r ../shared/requirements.txt

# Set up environment (optional, most examples work offline)
cp ../shared/.env.example ../.env
```

### Individual Agents
```bash
# Test each agent type
python examples/reflex_agent.py
python examples/model_based_agent.py  
python examples/goal_based_agent.py
python examples/utility_based_agent.py
python examples/learning_agent.py

# See hybrid implementation
python examples/hybrid_agent.py

# Complete smart home demo
python examples/smart_home_agent.py
```

### Complete Demo
```bash
# Run all agent types with comparisons
python examples/demo_all_agents.py
```

## 🏠 Smart Home Example

The smart home automation example demonstrates all agent types working together:

- **Security System**: Reflex responses to sensors
- **Occupancy Tracking**: Model-based state management  
- **Energy Optimization**: Goal-based planning
- **Comfort Balance**: Utility-based trade-offs
- **Preference Learning**: Learning agent adaptation
- **Integrated Control**: Hybrid agent coordination

## 🎓 Learning Progression

1. **Start with Reflex**: Understand basic stimulus-response
2. **Add Memory**: See how model-based agents track state
3. **Plan Ahead**: Learn goal-based planning and search
4. **Optimize Trade-offs**: Explore utility maximization
5. **Adapt Over Time**: Implement learning and improvement
6. **Combine Approaches**: Build hybrid systems

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Different problems need different agent types**
- **Reflex agents**: Fast but limited to immediate responses
- **Model-based agents**: Better for dynamic environments  
- **Goal-based agents**: Essential for planning and optimization
- **Utility-based agents**: Handle multiple conflicting objectives
- **Learning agents**: Improve performance through experience
- **Hybrid agents**: Combine the best of all approaches
